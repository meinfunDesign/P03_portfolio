            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              My role in this project mainly focused on concept ideation, character sketch and visual development design on the project’s form and features, as well as storyboard and flowchart for game stages. I also held smaller roles in writing the script and selecting background music in the final month to increase the immersive experience during the gameplay.

              The art direction of this project is inspired by the animated video series of violent adventure and narrative - Happy Tree Friends. The series includes cute woodland creatures that go through a happy adventure which turns into extreme graphic violence that causes injuries and deaths.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <h3>
            What I found to the biggest takeaway: </h3>
            <br>
            <h4>being design-driven with a concept in mind.
          </h4>
          <p>
            When our team came up with the idea of “an enthralling storyline with several twists presented in a violent yet cartoonish style,” it changed my view of what a project is. The project is not only can evoke people's curiosity to choose the story direction during the gameplay, but also the ending can be reflective for people to rethink what humanity is. I seek to bring this design-driven approach to future projects.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What I would Improve:
          </h3>
            <br>
            <h4>the experience between the visual animation and game atmosphere.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Our team came up a well-structured the storyline and portfolio quality, but we failed to find different soundtracks to fit different scenes in the game:  the immersive feeling of being surrounded by Dark Forest, Mushroom House and Dungeon, the sound effect of character movements, and the ambience of realistic immersion to accompany it all. Incorporating this into our final product would give the player high-quality appeal to have better game experience in the game.
