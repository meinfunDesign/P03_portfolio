              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                “Lexie Owen at Burred View Park, Vancouver” is a documentary video in exploring how Lexie Owen’s WNDW (window) gallery helps the work of emerging artists,writers and curators in the City of Vancouver. It is produced by three teammates and I as a final project for a film course at Simon Fraser University. Due to the recent WNDW exhibition started from the beginning to mid of October (2 weeks), the challenge of video production is to film the suitable footages and establish an interesting and cheerful narrative for the documentary.
              </p>
              <p>
                My role in this project mainly focused on post production such as color correction, text animation, editing transition, as well as equipment supplier for pre production. I also held smaller roles in managing the meeting time and drawing storyboard in the first few weeks.

              <h3>Art Direction</h3>
              <div class="img-wrapper"><img src="img/wndw/moodboard/moodboard_wndw.png" alt="moodboard inspiration for documentary"></div>

              <p>
                The art direction of this project is a warm and intimate atmosphere to make the audience feel a sense of connection. The length of the video will be around 3 to 5 minutes.  We are targeting audiences in Vancouver of adults who are interested in Fine Art and aspiring artists.              </p>

              <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>
                  The video will spread knowledge and raise awareness about this program and encourage Vancouver residences to come and experience fine art and connect. Also, it shows the uniqueness in the experience different from a regular art studio.

                <p> I took notes during the Skype meeting with clients and created a filming sign to announce that the camera is recording.</p>

                <p>
                  My team and I visited Megan's house on Opening Day on October 5th, and the chArt event at Megan's home on October 18th, and we went to Emily Neufield's gallery: Before Demolition on the same day. We filmed Emily Neufield's and Lexie Owen's interview on October 26th and reshooting Owen's part again on November, 16th to ensure we have enough content for the documentary. During the interview, I am responsible for the camera and lav mic sound recording to ensure the camera is continuing record and the quality of sound is clear. Since it was a sunny day, we first went outside to check whether if the natural light looks better than filming indoor. However,  I found that shooting the interviewees (Lexie and Emily) inside the field house with the natural light from the window and one small lighting 45 degree in front of her has less shadow and look more energetic. Unfortunately, there were only one member Emily Chow and me at that time. We should have taken the photos to compare the difference.

                    What I found to the biggest takeaway:</h3>
                  <br>
                  <h4>the experience of showcasing at City Hall.
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Being in the hubbub event at CityHall was nice. I got a chance to explain and promote the idea of WNDW gallery program. The result turned out great. People found that "WNDW" is a new form of a gallery. Even though the purpose of WNDW exhibition is to emerging the Vancouver artists to take place to exhibit their work, it can be considered as a unique way to represent the "contemporary art gallery in walking distance."
