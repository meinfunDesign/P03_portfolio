              <b>Name :</b> Tinko
            </p>

              He is quiet and dozy most of the time. He has a faith to trust his friends and believes in logic-thinking and science. However, when it comes to a decision between life and friends, he would prefer to stay in the lab and do research.
            </p>

              <b>Backstory :</b>
              Tinko was brought up in a small cabin in the woods. He has 10 other siblings, he was born in the middle. His family is very familiar with the woods as they have stayed there for many decades. They are the well-known hunters of the woods. Despite their slow actions, their hunting techniques and survival skills are very strong. Because of the hybrid species between snail and turtle (the slowest animals), they are naturally dozy and sluggish in action, which can cause massive amnesia when they grow older. As Tinko’s grandfather grew older, Tinko realised that he is unable to recognised anybody from the family, the neighbours, and his friends. Tinko did not want to become like him, despite the amnesia runs in their species, he still pursues his study in science in order to cure memory loss.
            </p>

            <p>As it is SFU’s vision to engage students, I was responsible for establish the story environment to engage the audience in the game experience. but more importantly to reach personal success for my second contest.</p>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>I am grateful that this position has offered me a lot of creative direction and many opportunities to grow and reinforce relevant skills. Design can at times operate in their own separate silos, as I have experienced previously having taken up both roles separately (read more about it here). As a character designer, I was able to take command of both ends and realize the close coordination required to fulfill two goals simultaneously: the design immersion to increase the number of story experience, and the visual goal to motivate audience to keep playing the game. As I seek to pursue more design roles, this experience has made me more mindful of every design intent and the bigger picture behind it.</p>
